😁-Arduino Memory Game-- 🎶🟡🔴🔵🟢🎶
A sequence memory game using Arduino and breadboarding. A pattern is displayed using LEDs and the player will enter the corresponding buttons in the sequence displayed by memory. Every time the player repeats the correct sequence, the game gives the sequence with an additional colour at the end. Or else, the players makes an error and the game restarts. The pattern increments by one light for each successful round.
